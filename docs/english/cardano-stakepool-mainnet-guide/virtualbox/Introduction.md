In this guide, we will be creating a stakepool from scratch on our own computer, using a tool called VirtualBox.

### What is VirtualBox?

VirtualBox is an open-source tool which allows you to run an OS, inside another OS. Using VirtualBox, you can for example run Windows inside macOS.

However, in this guide, we will not be using Windows or macOS, we will be using Linux. This is precisely the reason why we are using VirtualBox, as it allows everyone to participate, no matter your OS. Whether you are on Windows, or on macOS, you will be able to create your stakepool on Linux through the use of VirtualBox.

### Why Linux?

macOS and Windows aren't optimal to run a stakepool. When you think about it, a stakepool is essentially a server. But macOS and Windows weren't made to run servers. They were made specifically for the consumer market. On the other side, Linux was made with this server aspect in mind. This is also the reason why more than half of the servers in the world are using Linux.

### Technical requirements

The only thing you need to be able to follow this guide, is to have a computer with 8 GB of RAM, or more. Otherwise, there are no requirements.
