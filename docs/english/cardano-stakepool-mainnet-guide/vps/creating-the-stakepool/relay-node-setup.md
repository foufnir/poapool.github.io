In this part of the guide, we will be setting up a relay node on an additional DigitalOcean server.

This is actually a very small part, because the only thing you need to do, is go **[here](https://poapool.com/docs/english/cardano-stakepool-mainnet-guide/vps/Getting-Started#creating-your-digitalocean-server)** and follow the steps again until the end of part 5 of the guide.

Once you have done this, you can head over to part 8 of the guide, we will adapt later the topology configuration of our nodes so they communicate with each other.

Good luck!
