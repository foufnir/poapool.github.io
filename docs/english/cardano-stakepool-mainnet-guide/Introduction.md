There are two ways to follow the POA Stakepool Mainnet Guide.

The first one is to follow the VirtualBox-based one, where you will be building **everything on your local computer**, in a virtual machine (if you don't know what that is, no worries!).

The second way is to follow the VPS-based guide, where you will be building **everything in the cloud**, on what we call VPSs (if you don't know what that is, no worries!).

It's up to you to decide what path you chose. Nothing stops you from starting on VirtualBox, and then porting over your stakepool on a VPS. In fact, there is even a guide specifically made for that. So wherever you start, you can always go from one option to another.

The advantage of chosing the VirtualBox-based path, is that you will have 0 server costs, as well as access to a graphical interface (your computer's OS), this is not the case with the VPS-based guide, where you will be doing everything exclusively in terminal. So **if you consider yourself a tech "noob", definitely go for the VirtualBox path**. You can always port your stakepool over to the cloud once you have the necessary skills.

**If your goal is to experiment or to learn, go for the VirtualBox-based path. If your goal is to setup a professional stakepool, go for the VPS-based path** (unless you have a supercomputer at home of course).
