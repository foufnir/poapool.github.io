On the POA Documentation Hub, you will be able to find several guides regarding stakepools, smart contracts, decentralized finance,... The core idea of this guide is making not-so accessible things, accessible to everyone, no matter the subject.

No matter who you are, where you are, and when it is, you should be able to create and manage a stakepool, create your own dApps, manage your finances on-chain,... That's the true goal of the POA Documentation Hub.

Our team updates regularly these guides to make sure they are still up to date, and if they aren't, we make sure to clearly indicate that they are currently outdated. If you have questions, please don't hesitate and feel free to ask them in our **[Telegram chat](https://t.me/poapool)**.
